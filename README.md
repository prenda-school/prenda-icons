# Prenda Design System Icons Remade
This is a collection of icons for the Prenda Design System. They've been moved here from the design-system repo to remove dependencies from @prenda/spark.

To build the icons run `npm run build` in the root of the project. This will generate a `dist` folder with the icons in it.

To add new icons, add them to the `src` folder and run `npm run build` to generate the new icons.
